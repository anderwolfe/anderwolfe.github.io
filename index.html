Red team is defense side of security. They test vulnerabilities
Blue team's job is to maintain the security

SOC = Security Operations Center

"CS Analyst" is another name for Cybersecurity Engineer

Zero Day Vulnerability definition:
A zero-day vulnerability is an undiscovered flaw in an application or operating system, a gap in security for which there is no defense or patch because the software maker does not know it exists—they’ve had “zero days” to prepare an effective response.

Very simply: Zero-day is a vuln that the vendor doesn't know about or hasn't patched yet

[CIA TRIAD] Primary Concerns of Cybersecurity:

•Confidentiality: The act of sharing or revealing info only with authorized personnel

•Integrity: The ability to ensure that information or data remains unchanged and accurate

•Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to read and use information

Quizzes are unlimited attempts and should be 100%. They are 60% of the grade so it has huge impact.

In the business world, the cost of treating risk should never meet or exceed the potential loss

Impossible to mitigate all risks = residual risk

•NIST = National Institute of Standards and Technology
•The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary set of guidelines, standards and best practices

NIST: These steps are in order: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, Govern (govern applies to all of these values)

Define and purpose
Provide examples of what a response would look like

--

◘◘Phases of Risk Management Framework aka RMF: (this is similar to NIST framework steps just with a little more detailed step names)

1.) Categorize information systems
2.) Select security controls
3.) Implement security controls
4.) Assess security controls
5.) Authorize information systems
6.) Monitor security controls

---

My speaking notes about "Respond" small group activity"

We defined respond mainly from a communication stand point.


A quality response is beneficial because communication is key in reducing impact and preventing further damage and ethical repercussions.

Being open not only shows that you're committed to your users but that you're willing to alert them and look at them as not just a number.

Risk = Asset + vulnerability + threat

◘◘Terms Associated with risk:
•Control: Managing risk, including policies, procedures, guidelines, practices and/or organizational structures

•Vulnerability: Weakness in a system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat

•Likelihood: A weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability

•Impact: Magnitude of harm expected to result from the compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a resources on a system

•Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations
---

Broad based risk perspective:
Level one: Organization
Level two: Mission/business process
Level three: Information system
---

My speaking notes about "Vulnerability" small group activity:

Very fundamentally a vulnerability is a hole in your defense

To come back to things we discussed earlier in the class.
Some examples of vulnerabilities could be weak password policies

There's also social vulnerabilities such as poor training and poor user procedures
--

Classifications of threats: Global threats, regional threats, industry-specific threats, cybersecurity/digital threats

◘◘Common threat vectors:
•Unpatched vulnerabilities
•security misconfigurations
•Weak, leaked or stolen credentials
•Social engineering
•Insider threats
--

"On-path attack" is a newer name for a "man in the middle" attack

PCI-DSS is a set of security standards mandated by major credit card providers

IoA: Indicators of attack - indicators that someone is attacking but not necessarily has breached
IoC: Indicator of compromise - indicator that someone has breached
TTP: Tactics, techniques and procedures

Risk treatment methods:
•Risk avoidance - remove functionality to keep users from risk
•Risk modification (reduction or mitigation) - modify functionality to help prevent users from exposing data
•Risk sharing/transfer - shifting the financial responsibility of a potential risk situation, for example, purchasing insurance to cover a breach



Incident response definition: You address some sort of cybersecurity event that has violated a network or system

Incident Response methods:
•Identification
•Systems offline
•Contain the attack

IR (incident response) team models:
•Central IR team
•Distributed IR team
•Coordinating team

Phases of incident response:
•Preparation
•Detection and analysis
•Containment, eradication and recovery
•Post-incident activity

IR team services:
•Intrusion detection
•Advisory distribution
•Education and awareness

Types of AI:
•Narrow intelligence: AI systems designed to perform specific tasks within limited well-defined problems. This is where our AI is currently at.

•Artificial General Intelligence: Human like intelligence and can understand, learn and apply knowledge across various tasks. We have not yet reached this point of AI.

•Artificial super intelligence: AI that surpasses human cognitive abilities. We have not yet reached this point of AI.

Three states of data:
•Data in use: Data that is being actively processed
•Data at rest: Data that is being stored or archived
•Data in transit: Data moving from one location to another
