To make this work I had to Download and Install node.js for windows.

This sits in a windows directory with GitHub Desktop for Windows pointed at the directory and GitHub repo.

URLs go into my normal watchlist folder

Run import-watchlist.ps1 in Powershell to import tha watchlist folder into the watchlist folder in the github repo directory

Run generate.ps1 in Powershell to generate an updated watchlist.html file

Use GitHub for desktop to push to anderwolfe.github.io

To get to watchlist from index.html just open page and press Ctrl+Enter
