To make this work I had to Download and Install node.js for windows.

This sits in a windows directory with GitHub Desktop for Windows pointed at the directory and GitHub repo.

As of right now I can't get the GitHub workflow to automatically update the index.html file when a new file is uploaded, so you have to manually run the generate_index.js file using VSCode.

URLs go into watchlist

Updated: You can now just run the generate.ps1 powershell script and it will update the index.html file
